Thanks for checking out my application!

I used the flickr api both the get info api call to get the title, and the get sizes to get the images.

The only thing I couldn't figure out is the titles are all the same. I checked the titles on the photoset but they are different there and I can't seem to find the on screen titles anywhere.

Anyhoo, I am loading individual titles they just all look the same.

Cheers!
